This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing Google Ads data to make it ready for analysis
First started with meta data inspection to know about the data completely
The raw dataset contained missing values, inconsistent formats, spelling errors, and duplicates
Using Python (pandas, series,dataframe, regex), the dataset was transformed into a clean, structured format suitable for further analysis and visualization.
RESULTS:Cleaned dataset is free of missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
